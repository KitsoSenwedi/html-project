    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        House Blend coffee is unique to every coffee shop, every roaster, 
        and every drinker. That is what makes them so unique and so special. 
        The blending and serving process is built entirely on the preference 
        of the roaster and/or distributor. For example, Starbucks describes 
        their House Blend as â€œthe very first blend we ever created for you back in 1971. 
        The one blend that set the course for the way our master blenders and roasters work even today.
